This is the DirectFB port modified for use in
the OCAP project. This version is a refactored subset of the
DirectFB APIs which are useful in supporting the OCAP platform.

See "docs/html/index.html" for documentation on this modified version of
DirectFB.

The "win32fb" core is a minimal version for testing the port on a Windows
platform. It is not intended for production use. If you are using the
included "DirectFB Test" program, then make sure your Windows display is set
to 32 bpp mode.
