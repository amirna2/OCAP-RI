This directory contains test streams consisting of EAS section tables for the RI
emulator. The tables are saved as hexadecimal string text files (.hex) comprised
of hexadecimal strings and comments that describe the EAS section table contained
in the hexadecimal string.

These .hex files were converted to their binary (.bin) equivalent using the 
hex2bin.pl script in this directory. The generated .bin files were then moved to
$RICOMMONROOT/resources/fdcdata/eas-test-files directory and checked into Subversion.

See the $RICOMMONROOT/resources/fdcdaa/eas-test-files/README for instructions on how
to use the generated .bin files to demonstrate EAS processing.
