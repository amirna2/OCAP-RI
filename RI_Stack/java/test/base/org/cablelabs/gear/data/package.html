The <code>org.cablelabs.gear.data</code> package contains the classes that 
are used to manipulate various data resources in GEAR applications.
While this package is largely made up of <i>data wrapper</i> types and 
implementations, it is also home to the 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.Locator data locator} API used to locate
data resources.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<h3>Data Wrappers</h3>

The <i>data wrapper</i> types all implement the 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.DataWrapper} interface.  This simple interface
is simply used to "tag" a type as <i>data wrapper</i>.  The package is 
composed of the following types of data wrappers:

  <ul>
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.GraphicData}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.AnimationData}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.SoundData}
  </ul>

<h4>Graphic Data</h4>

The <code>GraphicData</code> interface defines an API for
the management and rendering of graphic pixel data.  It provides
methods for drawing and determining the size of graphic data.
Each implementation of the <code>GraphicData</code> interface 
is based on a different type of <i>wrapped</i> data.  
The simplest is the {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.ImageGraphic}, 
which is a <i>data wrapper</i> around a simple <code>Image</code> object.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.PortfolioGraphic} is a wrapping around 
a {@link org.cablelabs.gear.util.PicturePortfolio} object and a single
<code>String</code> id.

<h4>Animation Data</h4>

The <code>AnimationData</code> interface defines an API for 
the management and rendering of animation frame data.  It provides
methods for drawing individual frames, as well as determining the
number of animation frames, and the maximum size of all frames.
As with <code>GraphicData</code>, each implementation of the 
<code>AnimationData</code> interface is based on a different type
of wrapped data.  
The simplest is the {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.ImageAnimation}, which
is a data wrapper around a simple <code>Image[]</code> object.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.PortfolioAnimation} is a wrapping around
a <code>PicturePortfolio</code> and a set of <code>String</code> ids.
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.GraphicAnimation} class is the most
versatile: it is a wrapping around an array of <code>GraphicData</code> 
objects.

<h4>Sound Data</h4>

The <code>SoundData</code> class is an extension to the <code>HAVi</code>
<code>HSound</code> class.  It makes the <i>locator</i> used to load the
sound data an intrisic part of the object.  

<h3>Data Locators</h3>

The <i>data locator</i> types all implement the <code>Locator</code>
interface.  This simple interface is used to provide for various ways
of specifying the location of a data resource.  It is essentially a
wrapper around a <code>java.net.URL</code>, but allows for dynamic
construction of that <code>URL</code>.  
<p>
The package is composed of the following <code>Locator</code> 
implementations:

  <ul>
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.ResourceLocator}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.FileLocator}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data.URLLocator}
  </ul>
