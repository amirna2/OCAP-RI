The <code>org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator</code> package provides an
extension and an alternative to the standard HAVi <code>HLook</code>-based
classes.  The intention is to simplify the use of and customization of
look classes by using the <i>Decorator</i> design pattern.  This package
is a part of the overall SNAP2 GEAR for HAVi package.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The SNAP2 GEAR for HAVi decorator package is composed of abstract
and concrete <code>HLook</code> implementations.  Some classes serve
as functional replacement for their HAVi counterparts (e.g.,
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.GraphicDecorator} replaces
{@link org.havi.ui.HGraphicLook}) while others provide for additional
functionality (e.g., {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FontDecorator}).

<h3>Content Looks</h3>

The SNAP2 GEAR for HAVi looks in this package are capable of rendering
the major <code>HVisible</code> content types as well as the SNAP2 
GEAR {@link org.cablelabs.gear.data data} content types.  The following
looks are used to render content (and only content):

  <ul>
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.GraphicDecorator}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.AnimateDecorator}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.TextDecorator}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.GraphicDataDecorator}
    <li> {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.AnimateDataDecorator}
  </ul>

<h3>Decorator Design Pattern</h3>

With the default <code>HLook</code> scheme, extending existing looks
to introduce additional behavior is tricky at best.  Excluding certain
behavior or changing behavior is near impossible.  This is because
the <code>HLook</code> interface is not designed to be easily
extended.  The <code>showLook()</code> method does all of the work
(except in the case of text) involved in drawing content, leaving
programmers with an all or nothing dilemma when extending a given
class.  This shortcoming is overcome by the use of the <i>Decorator</i>
design pattern.

<p>

The <code>Decorator</code> design pattern is used in cases where:

<ul>
    <li>More flexibility is needed than static inheritance provides.
    <li>It is desirable to avoid feature-laden classes high in the 
    class hierarchy.
</ul>

Instead of adding resposibilities to a class, responsibilities are
added to an object.  A decorator object (also known as a wrapper)
has an interface that is identical to that of the object it
decorates.  The decorator is composed of a component object, to
which it forwards requests; additional actions are performed 
before or after forwarding.

<p>

Usually, when a {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.DecoratorLook} is 
created, a component look is specified.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.DecoratorLook} forwards 
requests to the component look, performing added actions <i>before</i>
forwarding.  This standard order is used so that the order of
decorators in a decorator <i>chain</i> can be counted on to 
perform operations in a pre-determined manner.

<h4>State Decorators</h4>

A general form of decorator whose operation is dependent on the current 
state of <code>HVisible</code> to be rendered is the <i>state</i> decorator.  
State decorators will usually extend the 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.StateDecorator} class
because it implements the minimum support needed to maintain state-related
information.

<p>

A state decorator maintains a set of states in which it operates.
Only when the <code>HVisible</code> to be rendered is in one of the
specified states will the state decorator do its job.

<p>

Examples of state decorator implementations are:

<ul>
   <li>{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.BGColorDecorator}
   <li>{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FGColorDecorator}
   <li>{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FontDecorator}
   <li>{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.OutlineDecorator}
   <li>{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FillDecorator}
</ul>

<h4>Fill Decorator</h4>

The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FillDecorator} is used to build 
up the functionality of the standard HAVi looks.  
One of the problems with the standard looks (in the original HAVi 
Level 2 UI specification) is that they have <i>too</i> much functionality; 
functionality that cannot be readily disabled.  
This includes the painting of the background with the background color.  
In order to have a look which does <i>not</i> paint the background, one 
has to completely rewrite <code>showLook()</code>, removing only the part 
that paints the background (presumably a single call to <code>Graphics.fillRect</code>).

<p>

The decorator-based solution is to have a separate <i>fill</i> decorator.
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FillDecorator} invokes the 
<code>Graphics.fillRect</code> method such that the <code>HVisible</code>'s 
background color fills its entire bounds.  

<p>

While this problem has been remedied in the latest HAVi specifications
(using the {@link org.havi.ui.HVisible#getBackgroundMode() background mode}), 
it remains a good example of how decorators solve a problem.  It is also
a good example of the power of decorators: it is certainly simpler to
add a new object that performs added functionality than to update an
existing class and its API.  

<h3>Composite Design Pattern</h3>

The common decorators are those that draw a given kind of content
(e.g., text, graphic, animation, or generic object).  These can be combined
with state decorators or other content decorators to affect the 
rendering of an <code>HVisible</code> component.  
Where with the standard HAVi looks, a new non-standard look would have to
be written to draw both text and graphic content, the graphic and text
decorators need only be chained together.

<p>

The power of the decorator look chain is also a minor hindrance.  Since
each decorator look is concerned with only one part of the rendering
<i>pipeline</i> (and that part only), decorators cannot act in concert.
Using a {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.GraphicDecorator} and a 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.TextDecorator}
to render both the graphic and text content of an <code>HVisible</code>
can be quite useful; but only if having the graphic and text drawn
irrespective of the other is the goal.

<p>

The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.PairDecorator} fills this hole.  
It allows the composition of two looks (which implement the 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.ExtendedLook} interface)
into one logical look.  This allows the content of each look to be 
rendered with respect to the other.  

<h3>Adapter Design Pattern</h3>

All of the decorators in the <code>org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator</code>
package extend from {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.DecoratorLook}.  
As such, problems may arise when attempting to use them with standard
HAVi components.
The <code>HVisible.setLook()</code> methods may throw exceptions if 
a look it not of the expected type.  For example, <code>HStaticText</code>
objects will only accept <code>HTextLook</code> looks.

To workaround this, the <code>org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator</code>
package includes look adapters for the standard HAVi looks.  When
<i>wrapped</i> around another <code>HLook</code> (e.g., a 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.DecoratorLook}), a given HAVi component 
will have no problems with the <code>HLook</code> not being of the right type.

For example, the following:

<pre>
    HStaticText label = new HStaticText();
    label.setBackgroundMode(HVisible.BACKGROUND_FILL);
    ...
    try {
        label.setLook(new HTextLook())
    }
    catch(HInvalidLookException e) { }
</pre>

is essentially identical to the following:

<pre>
    HStaticText label = new HStaticText();
    label.setBackgroundMode(HVisible.BACKGROUND_FILL);
    ...
    try {
        label.setLook(new {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.TextLookAdapter}(new {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FillDecorator}(new {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.TextDecorator}())));
    }
    catch(HInvalidLookException e) { }
</pre>

<note class=note>
Note the use of the {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.FillDecorator} to 
achieve the identical <i>look</i>.  
</note>

<h3>Wrapper</h3>

<code>HLook</code> classes that implement the <i>Decorator</i>
or <i>Adapter</i> design patterns implement the 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator.LookWrapper}
interface.  This interface serves too purposes:

<ul>
<li> To tag classes that implement one of these patterns
<li> Specify the API for accessing the component or <i>wrapped</i>
look
</ul>
