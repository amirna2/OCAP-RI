The <code>org.cablelabs.gear.havi</code> package (and its sub-packages) contain
the extensions to the HAVi Level 2 User Interface component library that 
make up the SNAP2 GEAR for HAVi product.  
It includes, among other things, JavaBean <code>Component</code> classes, 
HAVi <code>HLook</code> implementations, and utility and support classes.  
The package targets the HAVi API in general, not relying on any particular
implementation (including the SNAP2 HAVi implementation).  

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The <code>org.cablelabs.gear.havi</code> package is made up of the 
following types of HAVi-compatible classes:

  <ul>
    <li> Replacement components
    <li> Additional JavaBeans components
    <li> Containers
    <li> Support classes
  </ul>

Additionally, the {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.decorator} subpackage contains 
the SNAP2 GEAR implementations of the <code>HLook</code> interface,
with some notable additions.  

<h3>Replacement Components</h3>

The core of the <code>org.cablelabs.gear.havi</code> package is made up
of JavaBeans-compatible implementations of the HAVi UI interfaces
(e.g., {@link org.havi.ui.HNavigable} and {@link org.havi.ui.HActionable}).
These implementations are meant as a functional replacement for the
HAVi implementations (e.g., <code>HStaticIcon</code>, 
<code>HStaticText</code>, <code>HGraphicButton</code>, and 
<code>HTextButton</code>).  

<p>

One notable difference between the GEAR for HAVi components and those that
they replace is the lack of distinction between content types.  Where
HAVi has separate class hierarchies for text-based, image-based, and
animation-based components, the GEAR replacements only have one.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.Label} class is a replacement for 
{@link org.havi.ui.HStaticText}, {@link org.havi.ui.HStaticIcon}, as well
as {@link org.havi.ui.HStaticAnimation}.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.Button} class is a replacement for 
{@link org.havi.ui.HTextButton} and {@link org.havi.ui.HGraphicButton}
(HAVi does not define an <code>HActionable</code> <code>HAnimateEffect</code>
implementation).
This functionality is enabled simply by the fact that the GEAR component
hiearchy places no restrictions on the <code>HLook</code> implementations
that can be associated with a component.  Whether a <code>Button</code>
functions like an <code>HTextButton</code> or a <code>HGraphicButton</code>
is simply dependent upon the type of content and the look associated with
it.

<p>

GEAR for HAVi's support of the three types of <code>HVisible</code>
content doesn't stop there.  The entire <code>Label</code> hierarchy
implements the {@link org.havi.ui.HAnimateEffect} interface.  It is 
possible for a button to display an image, an animation, and text all
at the same time.  

<p>

Also, the GEAR for HAVi components adhere to the JavaBeans specification
with respect to naming conventions allowing them to be used within 
JavaBeans design tools.  Proper getter and setter methods are provided
for all properties, including so-called <i>indexed</i> properties.  
This is one of the shortcomings of the HAVi components that necessitated
the GEAR for HAVi extensions.  

<h3>Support classes</h3>

GEAR for HAVi also provides implementations of the HAVi 
{@link org.havi.ui.HTextLayoutManager text layout manager} interface
and the <code>java.awt.LayoutManager</code> interface.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.GearTextLayoutManager} provides additional
features beyond the HAVi default.
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.SnapLayout} layout manager can be used
to automatically set up <code>HNavigable</code> focus traversals.  

<h3>Additional Components</h3>

In addition to the replacement components, GEAR for HAVi also provides a
number of useful JavaBeans-compatible components.  Notable among this 
group is the {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.BackgroundVideo} component
which is useful in JavaTV environments for sizing and positioning of
the background video stream.  

<h3>Containers</h3>

GEAR for HAVi provides a hierarchy of <code>HContainer</code> extensions.
At the top of this hierarchy is the 
{@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.FocusContainer} class which is essentially
an <code>HContainer</code> which implements the <code>HNavigable</code>
interface.  The main purpose of a <code>FocusContainer</code> is to 
simplify the job of component traversals.  
The {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.SnapContainer} class extends 
<code>FocusContainer</code> to automatically set up focus traversals 
between child components.  
And finally, the {@link org.cablelabs.gear.havi.GearPanel} class provides
support for background fill/images and double-buffering.
