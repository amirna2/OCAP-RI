		<title>org.cablelabs.impl.media.player package</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	This package contains player framework classes upon which
	the various player implementation classes are built.  For instance,
	this package contains {@link AbstractPlayer}, the abstract base class
	of the entire player implementation hierarchy.  There are also base classes
	for different categories of players:
	<ul>
		<li>{@link AbstractVideoPlayer}</li> &mdash; for players that use the video device.
		<li>{@link AbstractAudioPlayer}</li> &mdash; for players that only use audio.
		<li>{@link AbstractServicePlayer}</li> &mdash; for players that decode an MPEG transport stream.
	</ul>
	This package also contains several player implementation classes, some of which are
	subclassed by the players in the <code>org.cablelabs.impl.media.content</code>  packages,
	allowing them to be instantiated via the <code>createPlayer()</code> method
	of the {@link javax.media.Manager} class:
	<ul>
		<li>{@link BroadcastServicePlayer}</li> &mdash; basic player for playing an MPEG transport stream
		from a network interface.
		<li>{@link BroadcastServiceMediaHandler</li> &mdash; version of <code>BroadcastServicePlayer</code>
		that can be used by a <code>ServiceContext</code> as a <code>ServiceContentHandler</code>.
		<li>{@link DripFeedPlayer}</li> &mdash; basic dripfeed player implementation.
		<li>{@link TSBServiceMediaHandler}</li> &mdash; player to decode MPEG transport stream
		through a time-shift buffer for trick-mode playback.
		<li>{@link RecordedServicePlayer}</li> &mdash; decodes MPEG transport stream from
		a <code>RecordedService</code>.
		<li>{@link RecordedServiceMediaHandler}</li> &mdash; version of <code>RecordedServicePlayer</code>
		that can be used by a <code>ServiceContext</code> as a <code>ServiceContentHandler</code>.
		<li>{@link SegmentedRecordedServicePlayer</li> &mdash; decodes MPEG transport stream
		from a <code>SegmentedRecordedService</code>.
		<li>{@link SegmentedRecordedServiceMediaHandler</li> &mdash; version of
		<code>SegmentedRecordedServicePlayer</code> that can be used by a <code>ServiceContext</code>
		as a <code>ServiceContentHandler</code>.
	</ul>
	Lastly, this package contains ancillary helper classes that are used by the above classes:
	<ul>
		<li>Clock-related classes: {@link PlayerClock}, {@link AlarmClock}, {@link ClockImpl},
		and {@link MediaTimeBase}.</li>
		<li>Video-related classes: {@link VideoDevice}, {@link VideoTransformationDfc},
		and {@link PlayerAssociationControl}.</li>
		<li>Service-related classes: {@link ServiceAdapter}, {@link Context}, {@link Authorization}.</li>
		<li>The general utility class {@link Util}.</li>
	</ul>
	</body>
