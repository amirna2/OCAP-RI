	This package contains classes providing the native interface to
	MPE functionality required by the JMF implementation.  It contains
	{@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.Manager Manager}s for the MPE Media and DVR APIs.
	The two manager interfaces are {@link MediaAPI} and {@link DVRAPI}, respectively.
	And the manager implementation classes are {@link MediaAPIImpl}
	and {@link DVRAPIImpl}.  This package also defines ancillary types that
	are necessary for some of the method calls&mdash;{@link MediaDecodeParams}
	represents parameters that are necessary for the native
	call to <code>mpe_mediaDecode()</code>.
