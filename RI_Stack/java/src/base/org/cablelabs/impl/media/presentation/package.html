	This package contains components comprising the presentation
	layer of the JMF implementation.  The presentation layer is used
	by the players to manage the presenation of content.  The elements
	in this package can be divided into the following categories:
	<ul>
		<li>
		Presentation Interfaces &mdash; define the contract
		that presentations must provide for players.  It includes these
		interfaces:
		<ul>
			<li>{@link Presentation} &mdash; base functionality
			supported by all presentation types.</li>
			<li>{@link VideoPresentation} &mdash; extends <code>Presentation</code>
			to define additional functionality needed by presenations that use the video device.</li>
			<li>{@link ServicePresentation} &mdash; extends <code>VideoPresenation</code>
			to define additional functionality needed by presentations that decode
			an MPEG stream.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		Framework Classes &mdash; abstract classes upon which the
		presentations are implemented:
		<ul>
			<li>{@link AbstractPresentation} &mdash; base class of presentation class hierarchy.</li>
			<li>{@link AbstractVideoPresenation} &mdash; base class of all presentations that
			use the video device.</li>
			<li>{@link AbstractServicePresenation} &mdash; base class of presentations
			that present an OCAP Service.</li>
			<li>{@link AbstractDVRServicePresentation} &mdash; base class of presentations
			that present an OCAP Service from a time-shift buffer or recording.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		Implementation Classes &mdash; concrete classes that implement presentations
		for various content types:
		<ul>
			<li>{@link AudioPresentation} &mdash; extends <code>AbstractPresentation</code>
			to provide an audio presentation.</li>
			<li>{@link DripFeedPresentation} &mdash; extends <code>VideoPresentation</code>,
			providing a drip-feed video presentation.</li>
			<li>{@link BroadcastServicePresenation &mdash; extends
			<code>AbstractServicePresentation</code>, providing a presentation
			of a broadcast OCAP Service.</li>
			<li>{@link TSBServicePresenation} &mdash; extends
			<code>AbstractDVRServicePresentation</code> to handle an OCAP Service
			presentation through a time-shift buffer.</li>
			<li>{@link RecordedServicePresentation} &mdash; extends
			<code>AbstractDVRServicePresentation</code> to handle an OCAP Service
			presentation of a <code>RecordedService</code>.</li>
			<li>{@link SegmentedRecordedServicePresentation} &mdash; extends
			<code>RecordedServicePresentation</code> to handle an OCAP Service
			presentation of a <code>SegmentedRecordedService</code>.</li>

		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		Presentation Context Interfaces &mdash; define the contract that the
		environment in which a presentation runs must support.  These interfaces are implemented
		by various player classes that use the presentations.  Here are the context interfaces:
		<ul>
			<li>{@link PresentationContext} &mdash; base context that
			must be supported for all presentation types.</li>
			<li>{@link AudioPresentationContext} &mdash; context that
			is needed by an {@link AudioPresentation}.</li>
			<li>{@link VideoPresentationContext} &mdash; context that
			is needed by an {@link AbstractVideoPresentation}.</li>
			<li>{@link DripFeedPresentationContext} &mdash; context
			needed by a {@link DripFeedPresentation}.</li>
			<li>{@link ServicePresentationContext} &mdash; context needed by an
			{@link AbstractServicePresentation}.</li>
			<li>{@link DVRServicePresentationContext} &mdash; context needed by
			an {@link AbstractDVRServicePresentation}.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</body>
