The <code>org.cablelabs.impl.havi</code> package (and its sub-packages) contains
additional classes that support the CableLabs HAVi implementation.  This includes
common support classes as well as CableLabs port-specific implementations.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The architecture of the CableLabs HAVi implementation is separated into two
distinct portions.   These are the core implementation and the 
support implementation corresponding to the {@link org.havi.ui}
and <code>org.cablelabs.impl.havi</code> package hierarchies.  
The <code>org.cablelabs.impl.havi</code> package hierarchy is divided into
three main subdivisions:

  <ul>
    <li> implementation support classes
    <li> porting layer classes
    <li> port implementation classes
  </ul>

<h3>Implementation Support Classes</h3>

The implementation support classes are those classes that provide core
implementation services to core <code>org.havi.ui</code> classes or
default/standard implementation support to various CableLabs HAVi ports.
<p>
The implementation support classes found in this package are:

<ul>
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.AwtBackgroundImage}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.AnimationManager}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DefaultVirtualKeyboard}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DBFrame}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DBPanel}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DVBContainer}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ImageRender}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.JMFSound}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.JavaxSampledSound}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.MatteCompositor}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.MatteCompositorJava2D}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.MatteCompositorDVB}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.SizingHelper}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.TextSupport}
</ul>

<h3>Porting Layer Classes</h3>

The porting layer classes are the portion of the CableLabs HAVi architecture
which make CableLabs's HAVi implementation easily portable.  It contains 
interface and base class definitions which greatly simplify the task of
porting HAVi to a new system.  The central figure in the porting layer
is the <code>HaviToolkit</code> abstract base class.  By specifying a
particular implementation of <code>HaviToolkit</code> one specifies the
CableLabs HAVi port implementation to be used.
<p>
The classes that make up the porting layer are:

<ul>
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.CapabilitiesSupport}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DefaultScene}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DefaultSceneFactory}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.DisplayMediator}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedBackgroundConfiguration}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedBackgroundDevice}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedGraphicsConfiguration}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedGraphicsDevice}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedScreen}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedScreenDevice}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedStillImageBackgroundConfiguration}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedVideoConfiguration}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.ExtendedVideoDevice}
	<li>{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.HaviToolkit}
</ul>

<h3>Port Implementation Packages</h3>

The generic Java Platform port can be found in the 
<code>org.cablelabs.impl.havi.port.generic</code> package.  

The port of HAVi to the MPE-based OCAP platform can be found in the
{@link org.cablelabs.impl.havi.port.mpe} package.
