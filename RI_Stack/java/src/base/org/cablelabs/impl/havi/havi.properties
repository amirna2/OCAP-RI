# The properties defined below are used to control the behaviour of the CableLabs
# implementation of HAVi. The following explains the format of each propery
# type accepted below.
#
# Boolean
#   Boolean properties do not specify a value. If the property is defined then
#   it indicates true. If the property is not defined then it indicates false.
#
# Class
#   Class properties have a value that indicates the full class name (including
#   the package) to be used.
#
# Dimension
#   Dimension properties are formated as "<num>x<num>". For example a dimension
#   that is 720 pixels wide and 576 pixels tall would be "720x576".
#
# Color
#   Color properties are accepted in several formats. Following are the accepted
#   formats for a color property.
#
#       1. A static color from java.awt.Color (such as "blue")
#       2. A string acceptable to java.awt.Color.decode(String)
#       3. A color property acceptable to java.awt.Color.getColor(String)
#
# Font
#   Font properties are formated in any of the following ways:
#      fontname-style-pointsize 
#      fontname-pointsize 
#      fontname-style 
#      fontname 
#   Where style is one of the three strings BOLD, BOLDITALIC, or ITALIC. 
#   Point size is a decimal representation of the point size. 
#   The default style is PLAIN. The default point size is 12.
