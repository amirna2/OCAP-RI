The <code>org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application</code> package represents the
main implementation of the {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.ApplicationManager} and
{@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.CallerContextManager} manager interfaces.  An overview
of the central classes in the package follows.  

<h2>AppManager</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.AppManager} class implements 
both the <code>ApplicationManager</code> and <code>CallerContextManager</code>
interfaces.  It also serves as a central gateway for maintaing some state information
for this package.  

<h2>ApiRegistrar</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.ApiRegistrar} class implements support
for API registration via the {@link org.ocap.application.AppManagerProxy}.  It provides
methods for {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.ApiRegistrar#register registering/storing}
and {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.ApiRegistrar#lookup locating} API classes.

<h2>AppClassLoader</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.AppClassLoader} class implements the 
<code>ClassLoader</code> used to load applications.  This class is implemented separate
from <code>DVBClassLoader</code> because it must be capable of handling things that aren't
otherwise possible via the <code>DVBClassLoader</code> interface.  

<h2>AppContext</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.AppContext} class implements the 
<code>CallerContext</code> interface.  It represents an instance of a running application.

<h2>AppDomainImpl</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.AppDomainImpl} class implements the
<code>AppDomain</code> interface which is used to implement the application-control
portion of the <code>ServiceContext</code>.  This class also provides the <code>AppsDatabase</code>
implementation accessible via the <code>AppManager</code> implementation.  

<h2>XletApp</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.XletApp} class implements the
{@link org.dvb.application.DVBJProxy} interface and is responsible for the
implementation of the Xlet application lifecycle.  It's immediate super-class,
{@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.application.Application}, implements the 
{@link org.dvb.application.AppProxy} interface.

<h2>Asynchronous Execution Support</h2>

Several classes are used to implement asynchronous execution for the 
<code>CallerContext</code> implementation.

<h3>ExecQueue</h3>

The <code>ExecQueue</code> is simply a queue of <code>Runnable</code> tasks
that should be serially executed by some thread.  Each application will maintain
an <code>AppExecQueue</code> which is an extension of <code>ExecQueue</code>.
Each <code>AppExecQueue</code> has a private <code>Thread</code> that is
responsible for pulling events from the queue and executing the <code>Runnable</code>.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

A task is an instance of <code>Runnable</code>.  In general they are posted
to an <code>ExecQueue</code> for subsequent execution by a <code>Thread</code>,
but being <code>Runnable</code>s may also be executed directly by a <code>Thread</code>.
<p>
The <code>WorkerTask</code> is a task that retrieves <code>Runnable</code>s from
a <code>ExecQueue</code> and executes them.  All threads in a <code>ThreadPool</code>
directly run a <code>WorkerTask</code>.  To change the queue that a thread operats
from, simply post a new instance of <code>WorkerTask</code> to the original queue.
When that task completes, the original <code>WorkerTask</code> and queue will be
restored.
<p>
The <code>ContextTask</code> is a task that executes another task within a specific
<code>CallerContext</code>.  Generic <code>Runnable</code>s should be wrapped by
a <code>ContextTask</code> before being posted to a <code>ThreadPool</code>'s queue.
<p>
The <code>ContextWorkerTask</code> is a task that performs the work of a 
<code>WorkerTask</code> within the given <code>CallerContext</code>.  The
<code>ContextWorkerTask</code> can be used to re-target a given thread to another
context and queue.  

<h3>ThreadPool</h3>

A <code>ThreadPool</code> is composed of an <code>ExecQueue</code> and a pool
of threads that pull from that queue.  Threads may be arbitrarily added or 
removed from the pool.
