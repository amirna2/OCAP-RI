The <code>org.cablelabs.impl.manager.graphics</code> package represents the
main implementation of the {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.GraphicsManager}
manager interface.

<h2>GfxMgr</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.graphics.GfxMgr} class implements the
<code>GraphicsManager</code> interface.  It causes initialization of both
the AWT and HAVi subsystems.
<p>
The <code>ThreadGroup</code> within which the AWT event dispatch thread(s)
get created is determined by the <code>Thread</code> that causes AWT to
be initialized.  As such, it is recommended that the <code>GraphicsManager</code>
is auto-started at <code>ManagerManager</code> startup.  This will ensure
that the <code>ThreadGroup</code> for the AWT event thread(s) is the system
thread group (rather than being the application thread group for the first
application to reference AWT/HAVi).
