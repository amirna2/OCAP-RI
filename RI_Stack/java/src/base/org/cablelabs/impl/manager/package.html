The <code>org.cablelabs.impl.manager</code> package represents the <i>Java Manager
Framework</i> for the OCAP-1.0 implementation.  This includes the basic 
<code>Manager</code> interface, as well as sub-interfaces for specific management
functionality (e.g., <code>ApplicationManager</code>).

<h2>Java Manager Framework</h2>

The architecture of the <i>Java Manager Framework</i> is centered around
the <code>ManagerManager</code> class -- the manager of managers.  It's 
primary purpose is to serve as the gateway to all concrete implementations
of the <code>Manager</code> interfaces.  Manager instances are accessed 
via the {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.ManagerManager#getInstance(Class)} 
method; created and initialized on demand.  The <code>ManagerManager</code> 
class also includes methods for pre-launching and shutting down all 
<code>Manager</code>s.

<p>

The <code>ManagerManager</code> is configurable, allowing different
concrete implementations of <code>Manager</code> interfaces to be 
specified.  This allows the rest of the OCAP-1.0 implementation to
rely on the manager interfaces and not the specific implementation.

<p>

The following <code>Manager</code> sub-interfaces are defined:

<ul>
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.ApplicationManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.CallerContextManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.EASManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.EventManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.FocusManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.GraphicsManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.NetManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.ResourceManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.ServiceManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.SignallingManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.SystemManager}
<li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.TimerManager}
</ul>

<h2>CallerContext</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.CallerContext} interface, as well as 
its associated manager (the <code>CallerContextManager</code>) serve as 
the gateway to the <i>logical VM rule</i> for other managers.  The OCAP-1.0
specification requires that each application appear to run within
its own <i>logical</i> VM instance.  To the <i>Java Manager Framework</i>,
the <code>CallerContext</code> is the embodiment of the logical VM
instance.  
<p>
Manager implementation code can retrieve a reference to
the logical VM context for the calling application using the 
{@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.CallerContextManager#getCurrentContext}
method.  The <code>CallerContext</code> instance can be used to 
map various resources within the manager implementation (e.g., by
using it as a key in a table).  However, the <code>CallerContext</code>
interface provides explicit support for resource attribution and
lifecycle change notification via the {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.CallbackData}
interface.
<p>
The <code>CallerContext</code> interface allows a manager to associate
<code>CallbackData</code> objects with the caller context.  These objects
can encapsulate whatever data the manager wishes to associate with the
caller context.  In addition, the <code>CallbackData</code> object is
notified when the lifecycle of the caller context changes.  
The <code>CallbackData</code> object serves as both a data wrapper and
a callback interface.
<p>
The <code>CallerContext</code> interface also provides the ability to
execute code within the context of the calling application.  This is done
via the {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.CallerContext#runInContext} methods.
The use of <code>runInContext</code> is preferred when calling application-installed
listener callbacks so that application code is executed only within the context
of the application.  In other words, application code is executed on 
application-specific thread(s).

<h2>AppDomain</h2>

The {@link org.cablelabs.impl.manager.AppDomain} interface provide for the
implementation of service selection as it relates to application acquisition
and launching.  An instance of <code>AppDomain</code> is maintained by
each instance of <code>ServiceContext</code>.
