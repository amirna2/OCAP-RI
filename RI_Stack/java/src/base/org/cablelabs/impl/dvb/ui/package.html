The <code>org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui</code> package contains interfaces and 
classes specific to the CableLabs implementation of <code>org.dvb.ui</code>.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

Currently contains the following interfaces and classes:

  <ul>
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.DVBGraphicsPeer}
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.DVBGraphicsImpl}
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.DVBGraphicsImpl2}
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.FontFactoryPeer}
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.DVBBufferedImagePeer}
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.DVBBufferedImagePeer1}
  <li> {@link org.cablelabs.impl.dvb.ui.DVBBufferedImagePeer2}
  </ul>

The <code>DVBGraphicsImpl</code> and <code>DVBGraphicsImpl2</code> classes 
provide simple adapters for <code>Graphics</code> objects; adapting them
to the <code>DVBGraphics</code> interface.  

<p>

The <code>FontFactoryPeer</code> class is essentially a placeholder for
compiling <code>org.dvb.ui.FontFactory</code> against.
It is expected that the actual implementation is provided by the AWT
implementation.  

<p>

The <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer</code> interface defines an implementation
layer for the {@link org.dvb.ui.DVBBufferedImage} class.

<p>

<i>
<b>Note:</b> that the <code>DVBGraphicsPeer</code> interface may need to be copied 
into the AWT implementation so that they can be referenced there.  
As such, changes to these interfaces should ensure that any such copies are 
also updated!
</i>

<p>

<i>TBD</i>

<h2>Package Design</h2>

This package provides for the abstraction of implementation for three
different classes in different ways.

<h3>FontFactoryPeer</h3>

The <code>FontFactoryPeer</code> is implemented by the AWT implementation 
directly.  I.e., <code>FontFactoryPeer</code> is a concrete class.
This is because how the peer is implemented is expected to be
tightly integrated with how <code>Font</code>s are represented and created
by the AWT.  The <code>FontFactoryPeer</code> class is accessed directly
by the <code>FontFactory</code> class.

<h3>DVBGraphics</h3>

The <code>DVBGraphics</code> implementation (using <code>DVBGraphicsImpl</code>
or <code>DVBGraphicsImpl2</code>) is <i>installed</i> into the AWT implementation.
This is done for AWT <code>Toolkit</code> implementations which implement the
{@link org.cablelabs.impl.awt.GraphicsAdaptable} interface.  Once the implementation
is installed (via the installation of a suitable {@link 
org.cablelabs.impl.awt.GraphicsFactory} class), it is expected that the AWT 
<code>Toolkit</code> implementation will wrap the <i>native</i> <code>Graphics</code>
objects with the specified <code>DVBGraphics</code> wrapper object.
<p>
The <code>DVBGraphicsImpl2</code> implementation is based upon Java2 
<code>Graphics2D</code> support.  While the <code>DVBGraphicsImpl</code> is
based upon generic Java <code>Graphics</code> and <code>DVBGraphicsPeer</code>
support.  

<h3>DVBBufferedImagePeer</h3>

Instances of <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer</code> are returned by an object
<i>factory</i> which selects the appropriate implementation for the current
platform.  Three implementations are assumed to exist; they are checked for 
in the following order:

  <ol>
  <li> AWT port-specific version - <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer0</code>
  <li> Java2 version based on <code>BufferedImage</code> - <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer2</code>
  <li> Java1 version based on <code>MemoryImageSource</code> and <code>PixelGrabber</code> - <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer2</code>
  </ol>

The <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer0</code> implementation is expected to be provided
by the AWT implementation if necessary.  The Java1 version provided by
<code>DVBBufferedImagePeer1</code> is expected to work for all Java-based DVB
platforms (including those based on PJava 1.2a, JDK 1.1.8, or Java2).
The Java2 version provided by <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer2</code> is expected to
work for all Java2-based DVB platforms (including those based on J2SE or
J2ME-CDC with Personal Basis Profile).  
<p>
<i>Note that currently, the <code>DVBBufferedImagePeer1</code> implementation
is considered non-functional.</i>
