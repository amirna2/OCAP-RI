/**
 * The resource proxy interface is implemented by objects which represent a
 * scarce resource to an application but where the actual scarce resource may be
 * a lower level object to which the application does not have direct access.
 * The indirection provided by ResourceProxy allows the retaining of state
 * regardless of availability of the actual resource.
 * 
 * Objects implementing the ResourceProxy interface are created by the
 * application program and may have a lifetime longer than the time a resource
 * is actually held by the application. A resource may be acquired and released
 * multiple times using the same ResourceProxy object. All interaction between
 * applications and objects abstracting over the resources themselves is carried
 * out via an object implementing the ResourceProxy interface.
