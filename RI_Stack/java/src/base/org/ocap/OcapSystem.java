     * Process while connected to the cable network – CableCARD device present. <br>
     * On invocation of this method, the APIs used for conformance testing,
     * specifically, <code>org.ocap.test.OCAPTest</code> SHALL be initialized
     * for use. This means that the implementation SHALL perform the following
     * actions:
     * <ul>
     * <li>a. Open a socket for receiving UDP datagrams on a port, the value of
     * which is specified in the <code>port</code> parameter passed to this
     * method.</li>
     * <li>b. Wait to receive a datagram that contains a string formatted thus:
     * <code>ate:a.b.c.d:xxxx:ppp</code> (string may be null-terminated), where
     * 'a.b.c.d' represents an IPv4 address, and 'xxxx' represents an IP port
     * number, and 'ppp' represents protocol type ('TCP' for TCP/IP and 'UDP'
     * for UDP/IP). Any received datagrams which do not contain a properly
     * formatted payload string SHALL be ignored. Once a datagram with a
     * properly formatted string has been received, the datagram socket SHALL be
     * closed.</li>
     * <li>c. Attempt to establish a TCP or UDP socket connection to the test
     * system using the IPv4 address and port number obtained in b. The protocol
     * type for the socket connection is specified by 'ppp' string in b. This
     * connected socket SHALL be used solely to transmit and receive data
     * originating from the <code>org.ocap.test.OCAPTest</code> APIs and SHALL
     * NOT be accessible to applications through other APIs. The TCP or UDP
     * socket connection shall have a timeout of 'infinite'. If this method does
     * not complete within the specified timeout period, an
     * <code>IOException</code> SHALL be thrown.</li>
     * <li>d. Return control to the caller.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <br>
     * If this method is called with both the <code>port</code> and
     * <code>timeout</code> parameters set to 0, then the OCAP implementation
     * SHALL not enable the conformance testing APIs, which SHALL just return
     * silently, without performing any action. <br>
     * If the monitor application does not call this method in the time
     * specified in section 20.2.2.3 Boot Process while connected to the cable
     * network - CableCARD device present, then the implementation SHALL
     * behave the same as if this method had been called with 0 specified for
     * both the <code>port</code> and <code>timeout</code> parameters.
     *
     * @param port
     *            the IP port number to listen for datagrams from the test
     *            system on.
     *
     * @param timeout
     *            the time, in seconds to allow for a communications channel to
     *            be established with the test system.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *             if application does not have
     *             MonitorAppPermission("signal configured").
     *
     * @throws IOException
