
v1.0.0
    * Changed build to reflect new version.
    * Refactored the interface test suite to be a bit easier to implement,
      and to use factories instead of set objects.  Also, interface tests do
      not *have* to extend InterfaceTestCase now, but it helps.
    * Changed APIs to be JDK 1.1 compatible.  Some tests still require at
      least JDK 1.3, due to the usage of EasyMock.
    * Added a Bash/Borne-shell script for the make (only tested on bash).
    * Added xml-apis.jar for the Xalan support on pre-JDK 1.4 systems.
    * Separated out the packages, and moved them into a single CVS project,
      to allow for a simpler piecemeal class inclusion mechanism.
    * Added itegration unit tests to test a complex class hierarchy setup.
      Donated to public domain for use as code samples for the interface
      testing extentions to JUnit.
    * Moved the 'SoftAssert' class to the 'AssertTestFactory', and refactored
      the 'IntegrationTestCase' into the 'SubTestTestCase' and
      'IntegrationTestCase' for better support of legacy JUnit test listeners.
    * Added ICxFactory to allow InterfaceTestCases the ability to tear down
      constructed objects.
    * Added CxFactory for easy naming of factories for improved traceability.
    * Refactored the way TestCaseParser works such that it is more pluggable.

v0.9.2:
    * Correction on 0.9.1 changelist: Xalan version is actually 2.3.1
    * Added package bugrepository to interface with junitlog package
      for bug traceability and report generation.
    * Fixed bug #526454.
    * Fixed bug #526478.
    * Fixed bug #526497.
    * Fixed bug #526511.
    * Corrected minor JavaDoc tag problems.
    * Fixed bug #526636.
    * Fixed bug #526710.
    * Expanded the documentation.
    * Added TimedProcess to utils.
    * StepTracker now calls TimedProcess when enabling events.  This allows
      for preventing the hang-up that seems to occur at the end of a
      long coverage run.
    * Added new tests to ui capture.
    * Started redesign efforts for auto-documentation.  This will be moved
      into its own project within GroboUtils to allow for JDK 1.2+ support.
      This will be moved out of GroboTesting as of v0.9.3.

v0.9.1:
    * Moved from Xalan-J 2.2-D14 to release 2.2
    * Added Ant testing framework
    * Migrated JUnit package from GroboUtils
    * Migrated ThreadSafety package from Groboutils (was under junit\jndi)
    * Added CodeCoverage package
    * Added RemoteAnt package
    * Created a more robust documentation structure.
    * Added dependency on the Jakarta BCEL library.
    * Added jdi package to contain multi-package dependencies on progamatic
      control over the JDI.
    * Moved files into new source structure, to break apart tests from code.
    * Added JUnit logging facility to help with self-documenting tests
      creating documents.
    * Added JUnit InterfaceTest extentions for testing Interfaces.
    * Moved MultiThreadedTestCase to MultiThreadedTestRunner in order to
      follow a better JUnit extention pattern (utility instance vs. TestCase
      subclassing).


v0.9.0:
    * Initial release.
    * Only included alpha version of UICoverage.
