<P>
The JUnit Interface/Hierarchial Test Case (IFTC) extention has the following
goals:
<OL>
    <LI>
    Allow for users to write tests for interfaces, abstract classes, and any
    extensible class.
    </LI>
    <LI>
    Provide a framework extension to JUnit, with a similar approach to writing
    tests as standard JUnit.
    </LI>
    <LI>
    A concrete class's tests must be able to use the framework to "inherit" the
    tests of the concrete class' implemented interfaces and super-classes.
    </LI>
    <LI>
    Allow for multiple <i>contexts</i> of a concrete class to be tested by
    inherited tests.
    </LI>
    <LI>
    Allow for easy tracing of failed tests.
    </LI>
</OL>
