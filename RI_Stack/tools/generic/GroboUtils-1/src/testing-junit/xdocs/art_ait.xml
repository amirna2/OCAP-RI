    <i>An article by Matt Albrecht</i>

<P>
For the series of articles on this site that concern testing levels, I
use the term system tests to refer to those tests that
verify that the whole application works as planned, and that outside forces
do not cause unexpected errors.  One particular subset of system tests are
Application Integration Tests, which I term to mean completely automated
system tests.
</P>
<P>
System level tests generally require much more interaction with the native
platform than <link href="art_iut">integration unit tests</link> or
unit tests.  As such, it makes sense to implement this logic in a scriptable
language, rather than Java.  Personally, I choose Ant, since it is a
Java native tool and has good cross-platform capabilities.
