<!-- The AutoXlet tag is the root tag of the document type. It has no 
     attributes, and must contain one or more Xlet tags.  
-->
<!ELEMENT AutoXlet (Xlet+)>


<!-- The Xlet tag specifies an Xlet to be run.  There are five attributes
     (three required, two optional):

     1.  name -  
            The name of the Xlet.  This can be any string used to identify 
            the Xlet being run - e.g., name of the Xlet class, common name
            for the test, etc.
     2.  orgID - 
            The orgID of the Xlet, as it is signalled within the OCAP apps 
            database.  This is specified within the hostapp.properties file.
            Should be of the format "0x1234".  For example, specify "0x0001" 
            for orgID=1.
     3.  appID - 
            The appID of the Xlet, as it is signalled within the OCAP apps
            database.  This is specified within the hostapp.properties file.
            Should be of the format "0x1234".  For example, specify "0x7000" 
            for appID=7000.
     4.  pauseAfterLast - 
            This attribute controls the behavior of AutoXlet at the end of
            an Xlet invocation using the Xlet tag.  After sending the last
            RCEvent to the Xlet, AutoXlet will wait for this amount of time
            before retrieving the results from the Xlet, destroying the Xlet,
            and starting the next Xlet.  Note that in some cases, Xlets may
            not require any user input to run.  In this case, AutoXlet will
            still wait before retriving the results, destroying the Xlet, and
            starting the next Xlet in the script.  The value specified must
            be in milliseconds.
	5.  startupTimeout -
			This attribute specifies the amount of time (in ms) to wait for
			the app to complete its initXlet() and startXlet() methods.  Since
			different xlets can take different amounts of time to startup,
			it is necessary to allow them to specify their own timeouts.
			The default value for this attribute (in the case it is not
			specified) is 60000ms.  If the application fails to complete its
			startup methods in this time period, execution of the xlet will
			be aborted.


<!-- The Xlet tag can contain zero or more RCEvent tags OR zero of more
     Repeat tags.

<!-- The RCEvent tag specifies a remote control key code to feed into the
     Xlet, along with some optional timing information.  There are four
     optional attributes:

     1.  name - 
            Specifies a name to be given to this event for the convenience
            of the user.  Rather than view output with "VK_CHANNEL_UP" and
            the like, the user can specify a more meaningful string, which
            will be saved in the output.  e.g., "Channel Up".

     2.  pauseBeforeNext - 
            This specifies the amount of time to wait before sending the next
            RCEvent to the Xlet.  This is a number in milliseconds.  For 
            example, to wait for 3 seconds before sending the next event, 
            specify pauseBeforeNext="3000".

     3.  monitorTimeout - 
            This specifies the amount of time the Xlet's monitor should block
            waiting for an asynchronous event to occur.  Monitors are an
            optional way to allow asynchronous events to be handled 
            synchronously within the AutoXlet framework.  When monitors are 
            used, a monitor timeout MUST be specified to prevent the monitor
            from blocking indefinitely in the case of an error and hanging the
            execution of the AutoXlet script.  A default timeout is specified
            within the monitor itself, but to override that default, specify a
            value using this attribute.  The value must be specified in 
            milliseconds.
     4.  getResultsAfter - 
            This specifies whether test results should be retrieved following
            this event.  Normally, test results are retrieved only once at the
            end of an Xlet test.  To make it easier for testers to associate
            results with particular events (or sets of events), specifying 
            this attribute as true will retrieve the results at the end of
            the event, and then clear the results.  In this way, results can
            be retrieved and printed to output as many times during an Xlet's
            execution as makes sense.

     The content of the RCEvent tag specifies the remote control keycode to
     send to the Xlet.  This is specified as the string identifier of a remote
     control keycode as specified within the org.havi.ui.event.HRcEvent
     or org.ocap.ui.event.OCRcEvent classes.  For example, to specify the
     equivalent of a "channel up", while sleeping 2 seconds before sending the
     next event, do the following:

     <RCEvent name="Channel Up" sleepBeforeNext="2000">VK_CHANNEL_UP</RcEvent>

<!-- The Repeat tag identifies a list of RCEvents that should be repeated a
     certain number of times.  There is a single attribute for this tag:

     1.  count -
             Specifies the number of times to loop over the contained series of
			 event tags

     The Repeat tag must contain one or more RCEvent tags.
