Description: 
The Memory application demonstrates CableLabs OCAP stack memory monitoring
capabilities.

Test Control and Evaluation:


Overview
--------
This sample Xlet demonstrates use of the org.cablelabs.debug.Memory class. The
Xlet can be used in this general scenario:
1. initialize/start the MemoryTestXlet
2. pause it
3. run another Xlet
4. pause the other Xlet
5. resume MemoryTestXlet and observe the changes in memory usage of the
stack.


How to run MemoryTest
---------------------
Include MemoryTest/MemoryTestXlet in your hostapp.properties. Use the
Launcher GUI to change the state of the MemoryTest Xlet as desired.


User Interface
--------------
The MemoryTestXlet has not user interface. The Launcher is used to
indirectly control it.

Xlet Control:
initXlet
	do virtually nothing
startXlet
	show current memory allocated
	show maximum memory ever allocated
	show the difference between any previous snapshot
pauseXlet
	hide the display
destroyXlet
	destroy allocated resources
