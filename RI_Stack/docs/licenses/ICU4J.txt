License Information
The ICU projects (ICU4C and ICU4J) use the X license.  The X license is a non-viral and recommended free software license that is compatible with the GNU GPL license.  This became effective with release 1.8.1 of ICU4C and release 1.3.1 of ICU4J in mid-2001. All new ICU releases will adopt the X license; previous ICU releases continue to utilize the IPL (IBM Public License).  Users of previous releases of ICU who want to adopt new ICU releases will need to accept the terms and conditions of the X license. 

The main effect of the change is to provide GPL compatibility.  The X license is listed as GPL compatible, see the gnu page at http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses. This means that GPL projects can now use ICU code, it does not mean that projects using ICU become subject to GPL. 

The text of the X license is available at http://www.x.org/terms.htm. The IBM version contains the essential text of the license, omitting the X-specific trademarks and copyright notices. The full copy of ICU's license is included in the download package.
